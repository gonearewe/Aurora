# Euphonium
Euphonium is a brand-new programming language designed and implemented by me for pure pleasure.

For more acknowledgement of parser combinators, refer to 
[scala-parser-combinators](https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators).
If you're looking for one that supports left-recursion and even ambiguity, 
consider [gll-combinators](https://github.com/djspiewak/gll-combinators) which
takes advantage of the GLL algorithm. And this is exactly what I'm currently 
using.

For examples of parser combinators, take a look of 
[javaone-2013-BOF-small-language](https://github.com/travisdazell/javaone-2013-BOF-small-language)
using scala-parser-combinators and 
[bundled examples](https://github.com/djspiewak/gll-combinators/tree/master/examples) of gll-combinators.

For help of detailed implementation of a language, turn to 
[Language Implementation Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/language-implementation-patterns/9781680500097/), and 
you may find the source code [here](https://github.com/gonearewe/LanguageImplementationPatterns).
For examples of language implemented in Scala, visit 
[decaf-in-scala](https://github.com/decaf-lang/decaf-in-scala) and corresponded 
[gitbook](https://decaf-lang.gitbook.io/decaf-book/). Also, you may learn how to build up a grammar 
through [grammars-v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) even if you don't plan to use Antlr.
